## Overall Test Status:

This game seems really enjoyable to play. It gives everyone a chance to hide and or seek. The maps are relatively big so you can hide really easy. There's a ton of hiding spots you can hide in. The time they give you to seek/hide is more than plenty. A few things that could be improved is making the setting to lower the time and potentially controlability over the size of the map or implement a circle in which you can hide in.
