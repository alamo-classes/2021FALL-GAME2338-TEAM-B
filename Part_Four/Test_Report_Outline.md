# TEST REPORT OUTLINE

## SECTION 1: OVERVIEW OF TEST RESULTS

### Overview

The test case results overall appear to be fall in line with the quality expected from them. These cases were ran to check the quality aspects of correctness, reliability, efficiency, integrity, usability, maintainability, testability, flexibility, portability, reuseability, and interoperability within Rocket League. 
It is our test case  that allows us to make sure all the controls reliabily opperate as intended on each platform and that there is no difference in quality between platforms. 

#### Number of Test performed
We have a total of 6 different tests performed which include coding, unit, integrations, regression, user, and acceptance testing. Integration and regression is needed due to the rollout of different seasons and skin. We want to make sure no new content makes previous content broken. User, acceptance, coding, and unit testing is done to make sure the content as a whole works as intended. Any content that is old(such as old skins and cosmetics) may break new game modes or the game based on interactions. 


#### Number of Defects

There was no number of defects as each test gave the expected result after a numerous ammount of tests ran. Each test gave the desired output allowing us to move forward with our testing and process in quality assurance. 

#### Requirements Status

Our test cases ran as intended and gave the expected result that we were hoping for. 

### Test Environment

We are in the production environment where the game has already shipped and is avalible on many platforms. Due to this, we are able to view community feedback and monitor certain aspects that the playerbase may be partaking in as a whole. This can include things such as harrasment, bugs, and exploits. It is our job to monitor what comes up with each new season and make sure that nothing breaks the game or puts the game in a worse state then it previously was. 

#### Hardware Configuration

We ran our tests on the various platforms that Rocket League is opperating on. This includes PC, Switch, Playstation, and Xbox. Though the consoles are all the same for the most part, the PC is where it gets more interesting as different specs may run the game differently. For clearity, the game will be run on a GTX 1660 graphics card with a Ryzen 5 processor. 

### Recommendation

Though our tests ran smoothly, there are things you can implement in order the better the experience players have in Rocket League. Things that can adress community issues like match throwing, xp farming, harassment, and scaming. For match throwing, there should at least be a "friendly fire" aspect put in similar to Rainbow Six where scoring on your own goal multiple times will kick you from the game. I know that sometimes you may accidentally score on yourself so a "three strikes" warning may be best. I feel like xp farming is in a decent spot as well as the anti-harassment features put in for in game chat. The disconnection timer for xp idle farming is quick and curse words are censored while also allowing you to vote kick somebody from a match. There is always room for improvement, but this seems like a decent spot to build up. Maybe a way to check if the player has only been giving one input for the past minute in order to counteract people putting their controller in a position so they are always moving. That can better crack down on xp farming. Scaming within Rocket League is a thing that I dont know much about and thus cannot give a lot of recommendations for.
