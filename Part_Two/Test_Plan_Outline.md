# Section 1: General Information

## Summary

A car physics game with online multiplayer that lets players face off against each other in an 8 vs 8 soccer like experience. The Unreal Engine is the engine that is used for Rocket league and will be tested on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. 

We will be looking for these Qualitys: 

* Correctness – satisfies requirements 

* Reliability – performs intended function consistently 

* Efficiency – amount of computing resources or code 

* Integrity – controlled access to the software 

* Usability – effort required to learn software 

* Maintainability – locating and fixing errors 

* Testability – effort required to test 

* Flexibility – effort required modifying operational program 

* Portability – effort required to transfer from one configuration to the next 

* Reusability – program can be used in other applications 

* Interoperability – effort to couple one system with another 

## Environment/User Community

For the Environment we will be using GitHub and Visual Studio. We will be in a Development environment doing unit testing to write out the code. After that we will  do a QA Environment looking for failures that are happening in the build. Finally the Stage Environment is where we will see if it meets the criteria of the product. 



## Test Objectives

These are the Test we will be doing: 

* Coding Test 

* Unit Test 

* Intergrations Test 

* Regression Test 

* User Test 

* Acceptance Test

## Acceptance Criteria

The game meets many of the criterias with it's gameplay, features, and online multiplayer. With Rocket league season 5 out with new arena variant players are now able to see what needs to be reported.

Players Report:
* Text Harassment
* Verbal Harassment
* Match Throwing or Griefing
* Intentionally Idle
* XP Farming
* Inappropriate Player Name
* Inappropriate Club Name
* Trade Scam

Report players via the Main Menu:
* You can now report players from the Recent Players section of your Friends List
* Go to Recent Players, select the relevant player name, and choose Report Player
* The report reasons listed here are identical to the reasons available during a match
* You can now select more than one report reason
* Example: If a teammate is harassing you in team chat, and is also own-goaling, you can select both “Text Harassment,” and “Match Throwing or Griefing”
When reporting a player for Text Harassment, press the Chat Log button to see chat lines from the reported player
A new pop-up notification will appear when you successfully report another player
To keep in-game visibility clear, this message will appear in the upper-left corner if you are reporting during a match

Bugs Fixed

* Fixed controller focus bug on post-match celebration screen
* Fixed appearance of the Tumbling Blocks Decal
* The grill on Painted Tygris cars may show as unpainted when some non-animated Decals are equipped
* Fixed a bug preventing Apex Wheels from being equipped on '99 Nissan Skyline GT-R R34
* Removed option to add friend as Epic Friend when they are already on your friends list
* Fixed a bug preventing NFL Decals from showing up in Garage when using Filters
