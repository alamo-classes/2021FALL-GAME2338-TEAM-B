# Section 1: General Information

## Summary

A car physics game with online multiplayer that lets players face off against each other in an 8 vs 8 soccer like experience. The Unreal Engine is the engine that is used for Rocket league and will be tested on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. 

We will be looking for these Qualitys: 

* Correctness – satisfies requirements 

* Reliability – performs intended function consistently 

* Efficiency – amount of computing resources or code 

* Integrity – controlled access to the software 

* Usability – effort required to learn software 

* Maintainability – locating and fixing errors 

* Testability – effort required to test 

* Flexibility – effort required modifying operational program 

* Portability – effort required to transfer from one configuration to the next 

* Reusability – program can be used in other applications 

* Interoperability – effort to couple one system with another 

## Environment/User Community

For the Environment we will be using GitHub and Visual Studio. We will be in a Development environment doing unit testing to write out the code. After that we will  do a QA Environment looking for failures that are happening in the build. Finally the Stage Environment is where we will see if it meets the criteria of the product.
