# Project Schedule

We assigned each of us to do a task for each test. This helps us keep track of who is doing what they are assigned. We discussed many things for our test plan such as quality and objectives. Every other week our team discussed what needs to be done and tested. This really helps out having good balance to keep track of each member.
