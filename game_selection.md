### Rating

I give this game a 9 star rating out of 10 stars.

## Summary

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rocket league is a fast paced game and must score goals on their oponents net. You can choose to work as a team or play on your own in certain game modes. When you do choose to work as a team, you really have to communicate with one another offensively and defensively to score goals or protect your net. The team with the highest goals wins, but if you guys end in a tie, you will lead into overtime in a short period of time until a team scores.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout the game, you will have the ability to boost to catch up to the ball or hit the ball harder to score on your oponents net. Don't worry if you run out of boost, you can restock up on boost with the boost pads they have throughout the field. If you'd like you can even fully charge it with one of the special boost pads they have on the field. You'll notice they look different than your normal boost pad. Another little neat trick is when you boost, you can actually use that boost to fly in the sky for a bit. If you can time it perfectly you can actually fly with the ball from one side of the field to the other side and score your easy goal. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rocket league is also known for its game modes. They have a variety of game modes from solo, 2v2, 3v3 and some other creative game modes like hoops, chaos & even snow day. So if you have friends to play with you can go with  some 2v2's or 3v3's. Or if you want to play with other people in the community, they have an online option too! You can choose to play unranked or ranked if you feel competitive. My personal favorite is the game mode hoops. Instead of soccer nets, its a basketball court field and instead of making the ball go straight into the net, you have to bounce the ball relatively high in order to score the goal into the hoop. Once you get the hang of it, you'll love it! 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now onto the competitive side of the game. When I first started playing, I would've never thought you could do all sorts of tricks on scoring to your oponents net. You can fly up in the air, you can backflip it, you can front flip, you can bounce it off other cars or walls within the arena. There is endless possibilities on how you can manage to score it. Now as far as ranks goes, you have Silver Tier, Gold Tier, Blue Tier and Champion Tier. Each tier has 4 titles in them except Champion Tier, that one only has 3 titles. In order to be ranked, you need to play 10 ranked games and out of those 10 games, you'll be tested on your performance meaning how many points you got. But what really affects you is the win or lose scenario. If you lose 1 game, that will affect you more than just points, meaning you need to win at all costs.

## Final Thoughts

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After playing rocket league for a while, I have to say, I really enjoyed playing the game. It's basically soccer but with a twist. You're using cars and depending on the game mode you have different soccer balls. You can go as far as customizing your car, and customizing some side effects when you score a goal. I do like the different types of game modes, because it brings new elements to be played around with. It makes the game more interesting because you can use power-ups or different tricks depending on the game mode. The one thing I personally love is the pass. You can buy the pass and every time you reach a tier on it, you can unlock something for your cars or items to put on your cars. And if you wish to buy more cars, you can inside the item shop. Overall, I really enjoy the game, it's very different from what you normally play. With that being said, I hope you enjoy playing the game as much as I do.
