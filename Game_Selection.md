## Summary

Rocket League is a competitive multiplayer vehicle soccer game developed and published by Psyonix. The game is about cars playing soccer and it is up to your team to score as many points as possible before time runs out. You score points by driving your car into the ball and into the goal. Whoever has the most points win. The game is very competitive and requires team work if players want to win. Each team can go up to eight players and your team will be trying to stop the opposite side of the field from scoring. The game also lets players customize cars for more fun. This game idea works very well and challenged me to get better with my team to win. 

Rocket League controls are like a car. Players will be driving and accelerating across the field with precision to get the ball. Cars can jump in the air for aerial maneuvers such as flips and corkscrew. The game is physics based so the ball will be in the air when a car hits it. Vehicles can traverse on wall giving the player a better angle to hit the ball when airborne. Cars have the ability to boost for a short burst of speed for a brief time. Boosting is important for control and players will need to manage the boost by running over pads that are on the floor for refills. I love the controls they are very fluid and responsive for this style of game. 

Rocket League also has different game modes than just soccer. Ice hockey is a mode where the ball is now a puck and can slide on the floor for different movement. Basketball mode is where players now need to get the ball into a hoop in the air instead of a goal net. Drop shot is where you now need to break the opponent's floor and drop the ball into the hole to score a point. Finally, rumble mode is where cars can get power ups to control or interrupt the ball on the field. All these modes are fun and intuitive and did not hamper my experience. 

## Final Thoughts

Overall, Rocket League was excellent the game idea is fun and engaging. I love the many modes that it has and noun of them felt terrible. The controls for this game were perfect having good physics and driving mechanics with a sense of speed. I love the customization that I gave to my car every time I earned currency for it. I think the only terrible thing about this game is playing alone with an AI. The AI is not that smart and that can make the game not challenging. I prefer to play with friends or others since it was made with multiplayer in mind.
